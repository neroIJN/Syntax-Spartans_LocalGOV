## Authentication System
✅ **Completed**: MySQL-based authentication with JWT tokens

The authentication system has been successfully implemented with the following features:
- MySQL database for user storage
- Sequelize ORM for database operations
- JWT-based authentication
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Protected routes with AuthGuard
- Login/Register pages
- User profile photo storage

### Technical Implementation

#### Backend
- MySQL User model (`/backend/models/MySQLUser.js`)
- Authentication controller (`/backend/controllers/mysqlAuthController.js`)
- JWT middleware (`/backend/middleware/auth.js`)
- MySQL database connection (`/backend/config/database.js`)

#### Frontend
- Authentication hook (`/frontend/hooks/useAuth.ts`)
- Login page (`/frontend/app/auth/login/page.tsx`)
- Registration page (`/frontend/app/auth/register/page.tsx`)
- AuthGuard component (`/frontend/components/AuthGuard.tsx`)
- Dashboard page (`/frontend/app/(citizen)/dashboard/page.tsx`)

### Testing
- Created test user script (`/backend/create-test-user.js`)
- Added authentication test page (`/frontend/app/test/page.tsx`)
- Set up automatic redirect from `/citizen/dashboard` to `/dashboard`
- Created test environment script (`/Start-TestEnvironment.ps1`)
- Documented testing procedures (`/AUTH_TESTING_GUIDE.md`)

### Next.js Route Structure
- Using route groups with parentheses `(citizen)` for organization
- Dashboard accessed at `/dashboard` (not `/citizen/dashboard`)
- Added redirect page to handle URL path confusion

## Next Steps
- Implement more dashboard features
- Add user profile editing
- Enhance the notification system
- Add officer dashboard functionality

## Open Issues
None - Authentication system is fully functional

## Notes on URL Structure
The Next.js App Router uses route groups (folders with parentheses) for organizing routes without affecting the URL structure. This means:

- Routes in `app/(citizen)/dashboard/page.tsx` → Accessed at `/dashboard`
- Routes in `app/(officer)/dashboard/page.tsx` → Accessed at `/dashboard` (with officer role)

This can be confusing for users who might try to access `/citizen/dashboard`, so we've added a redirect page to handle this case.
