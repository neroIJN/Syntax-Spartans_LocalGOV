# MySQL Authentication Implementation Summary

## Overview
We have successfully implemented a MySQL-based authentication system for the LocalGOV application, replacing the original MongoDB authentication. The system uses:
- MySQL database with Sequelize ORM
- JWT authentication tokens
- bcrypt for password hashing
- User profile photo storage
- Protected routes with AuthGuard component

## Key Components

### Backend
1. **MySQL Database Configuration**
   - File: `/backend/config/database.js`
   - Purpose: Sets up MySQL connection with Sequelize

2. **MySQL User Model**
   - File: `/backend/models/MySQLUser.js`
   - Purpose: Defines user schema with validation and methods

3. **MySQL Authentication Controller**
   - File: `/backend/controllers/mysqlAuthController.js`
   - Purpose: Handles login, registration, and token verification

4. **JWT Authentication Middleware**
   - File: `/backend/middleware/auth.js`
   - Purpose: Verifies JWT tokens for protected routes

5. **Database Utilities**
   - Files: `/backend/setup-database.js`, `/backend/check-database.js`
   - Purpose: Scripts to initialize and check database state

6. **Test User Creation**
   - File: `/backend/create-test-user.js`
   - Purpose: Creates a test user for testing authentication

### Frontend
1. **Authentication Hook**
   - File: `/frontend/hooks/useAuth.ts`
   - Purpose: React hook for managing authentication state

2. **AuthGuard Component**
   - File: `/frontend/components/AuthGuard.tsx`
   - Purpose: Protects routes from unauthorized access

3. **Login Page**
   - File: `/frontend/app/auth/login/page.tsx`
   - Purpose: Provides login form and authentication logic

4. **Dashboard Pages**
   - Files: 
     - `/frontend/app/(citizen)/dashboard/page.tsx`
     - `/frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
   - Purpose: Protected dashboard and redirect logic

5. **URL Redirection**
   - File: `/frontend/app/citizen/dashboard/page.tsx`
   - Purpose: Redirects from `/citizen/dashboard` to `/dashboard`

6. **Testing Page**
   - File: `/frontend/app/test/page.tsx`
   - Purpose: Tests authentication APIs and state

## Next.js Routes Structure
The application uses Next.js App Router with route groups (folders with parentheses):
- Routes in `app/(citizen)/...` → URL path is `/...` (not `/citizen/...`)
- Routes in `app/(officer)/...` → URL path is `/...` (not `/officer/...`)

This is why we needed to create a redirect from `/citizen/dashboard` to `/dashboard`.

## Testing
To test the authentication system:
1. Run the PowerShell script: `.\Start-TestEnvironment.ps1`
2. This script will:
   - Start the backend server
   - Create a test user if needed
   - Start the frontend development server
   - Open the testing guide
   - Provide links to test pages

## Authentication Flow
1. User enters credentials on login page
2. Backend validates credentials and returns JWT token
3. Frontend stores token in localStorage
4. AuthGuard component checks for token on protected routes
5. If no token exists, user is redirected to login
6. If token exists but is invalid, user is logged out
7. Dashboard loads authenticated user data from token

## Conclusion
The authentication system is now fully functional with MySQL storage, JWT tokens, and secure password handling. The frontend correctly handles authentication state and protects routes from unauthorized access. The test environment makes it easy to verify functionality.

All requirements have been met:
- ✅ MySQL database for user storage
- ✅ JWT authentication
- ✅ Protected routes
- ✅ User profile photos
- ✅ Proper redirect handling
